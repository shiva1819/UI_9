Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

			FLOATS: <br>
		* none: the element does not float. This is the initial value. <br>
		* left: floats the element to the left of its container. <br>
		* right: floats the element to the right of its container. <br>
		* inherit: the element inherits the float direction of its parent.<br>
		<hr>
		* floats can be used for this censorious:

		* broken floats <br>
		<img src="images/floats_collapse.png" alt=""> <br>
		* so it can be fixed by using clearfix method for the parent element. <br>
		ex. <br>
		clear:both; /*left | right */
		</p>
		<hr>

			* for layout censorious: this is the best example: <br>
