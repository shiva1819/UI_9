			 <h4>What is Javascript ? </h4>
			 <p style="padding-left: 50px;">
			 	JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website (for example: games, responses when buttons are pressed or data entered in forms, dynamic styling, animation). This article helps you get started with this exciting language and gives you an idea of what is possible.

			<h4>Comments in JS</h4>
			<p> 
				We can use single line comments and multi line comments <br> 
				single line comments can be as <br>

				<p>// Some commented statements(single line comments )</p>
				/*

				*/

			<h4>Variables</h4>
			<p>
				Variables are containers that you can store values in. You start by declaring a variable with the var keyword, followed by any name you want to call it:
				<br>
				for Ex: <br>
				var name = "Shiva" <br>
				var num = 1010
			</p>
		</li>

			<h4> Data Types</h4>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li> 
						String—any number of characters, <br>
						for example "a", "one", "one 2 three". 
					</li>
					<li>
					 	Number—this includes floating point numbers as well as integers, <br>
					 	for example 1, 100, 3.14.  
					</li>
					<li> Boolean—can be either true or false. </li>
					<li> 
						Undefined—when you try to access a variable that doesn't exist, you get the
						special value undefined. The same will happen when you have declared a
						variable, but not given it a value yet. JavaScript will initialize it behind the
						scenes, with the value undefined. 
					</li> 
					<li> Null—this is another special data type that can have only one value, the have only 	one value, the only one value, the
						null value. It means no value, an empty value, nothing. The difference with
						undefined is that if a variable has a value null, it is still defined, it only
						happens that its value is nothing
